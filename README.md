# CYPHER - THE MAINFRAME HACKING TOOL

*Please don't use on a production environment as the program is super super malicious and baaaaad*

Using AI and very well trained neural networks, Cypher brings a lot to the table in terms of methodlogy 

***HOW DOES IT WORK***

Cypher uses AI to locate the admin folder on the mainframe thn uses a reverse proxy to redirect all the traffic to your machine and then overrides the kernel file to inject itself into startup processes so whenever the mainframe is online, Cypher directs all the packets back to you !

***CURRENT FEATURES***

1. Disables all the security software on the target mainframe
2. Backdoors the entire mainframe and all the connected devices to it 
3. Using AI it can replicate itself into safe locations on the file system and "hibernates" until the mainframe is online again 
4. Once detected which is only possible if someone knew of the attack and not using an antivirus, Cypher begins destroying the mainframe by executing the very naughty naught command of rm -rf / then deletes itself
