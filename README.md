# CYPHER - THE MAINFRAME HACKING TOOL

*Please don't use on a production environment as the program is super super malicious and baaaaad*

Using AI and very well trained neural networks, Cypher brings a lot to the table in terms of methodlogy 

***HOW DOES IT WORK***

Cypher uses AI to locate the admin folder on the mainframe thn uses a reverse proxy to redirect all the traffic to your machine and then overrides the kernel file to inject itself into startup processes so whenever the mainframe is online, Cypher directs all the packets back to you !
